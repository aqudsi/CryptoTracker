This is an app built using HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, and uses AJAX for the API calls. It's a cryptocurrency tracker, which tracks the rate of change of any alt coin on the current market, and displays this information on a graph using Canvas.js.
Additional features include a ticker with the current value of Bitcoin in any currency (drop down menu is provided), as well as a currency to Bitcoin converter. 

Users can select at what percentage they'd like to "buy in" and once that percentage has been met, a second graph will be populated that tracks the rate of change at the time of the buy in. 

A second option to "sell" appears after the purchase condition has been met, and once the sell percentage has been met, then the application stops and tells you approximately how much you made in bitcoin value.
