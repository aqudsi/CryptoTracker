psuedocode notes

Ahmer:
-implement presence so the application can track when a specific user ran the program last, and compare the last
recorded bitcoin value (in firebase) with the current value that is being pulled from the API. based on that, it'll make a recommendation to the user to either buy or sell
-make a timer function that calls the AJAX request every 6 seconds. 
-have the user input the symbol of the cryptocurrency they want to track



var userInput = BTC; //received via user input on website
var cryptocurrencies = [];
cryptocurrencies.push(userInput)

function isSymbol(element) {
  return element === userInput;
}

[BTC].find(isSymbol); // BTC


if(symbol == userinput)
{
	var CCval = response[cryptocurrencies[0]].price_btc;
}
